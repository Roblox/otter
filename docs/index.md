
Otter is a simple animation library built around spring simulation. It consists of two packages:

* [Otter](api-reference.md#otter) - The animation library that creates `Motors` and steps them towards `Goals` on each heartbeat
* [ReactOtter](api-reference.md#reactotter) - A library that wraps Otter in a convenient and flexible hook for React function components
